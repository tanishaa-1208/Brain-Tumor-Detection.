# 🧠 Brain Tumor Detection using CNN & Transfer Learning

This project builds and compares multiple deep learning models for Brain MRI tumor detection. The goal is to classify MRI images as tumor or no tumor using both a custom CNN and state-of-the-art transfer learning architectures.
(Exact Replication of the Research Paper: “Brain Tumor Detection Using Deep Learning and CNN Architecture”)

# 🚀 Models Implemented

- Proposed Custom CNN
- EfficientNetB0 (Transfer Learning)
- ResNet50 (Transfer Learning)

Each model is trained, evaluated, and compared using:

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1-Score
- Confusion Matrix
- Grad-CAM visualisations

# 📁 Project Contents

- Brain_MRI_SCAN.ipynb → Main notebook (data loading, training, evaluation, visualisations)
- Model comparison metrics
- Confusion matrix heatmaps
- Grad-CAM outputs

# 📊 Results Summary

The models were evaluated on a test set, and EfficientNetB0 / ResNet50 showed the highest performance, while the custom CNN provided a lightweight alternative.

# 🧩 Techniques Used

- Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- Transfer Learning
